									<h4 id="about-title">About Odyssey Of Ultimate:</h4>
									<p>We are a dedicated team who enjoys the finer games in life. We were tired of seeing the same old
										Wiki-form pages for Super Smash Bros. Games and wanted to change it. We have all characters as soon as they are released. If you
										enjoy a certain character, there is a section at each page bottom with other games they have been in.</p>
									<p>At the moment we do not include move sets, however, we include a basic knowledge and background on them.
										Move sets are nice to know, but nothing beats the thrill of being able to pull them off during an intense stock-battle. We
										are all nerds at heart, and growing up with most of these games, we have a heartfelt knowledge on most games
										and most characters. We are trying to keep this site minimalistic in our approach, but still have an new and fresh feel.</p>
									<p>Creating an account with us is as easy as could be. Sign up with your email, set-up a password, and you are set from there. This
										functionality allows the user to favorite their favorite character to refer back to later. As this is just a basic start-up site,
										we will be adding further functionality to it later. Look forward to see you join the page and start adding characters to your roster.</p>
