Though Luigi is heroic and kind like his brother, he tends to chicken out of some situations that seem to be too scary or beyond his capabilities. But when he needs to, Luigi is as brave as Mario during events with strong enemies. He seems to be afraid of ghosts and startled quite easily as seen in the Luigis Mansion games. If you like games that are similar to one of the first side scrolling platformers, with an easy to follow story then these games will be perfect to try. If you are into a darker video game, try Luigis Mansion, or Luigis Mansion 2.",

At the age of 36, Captain Falcon had built a reputation as one of the best in the galaxy. Getting bored with bounty hunting, he joined F-Zero to fuel his competitive side, with his own ship, the Blue Flacon. The Captain is always portrayed as Brash and flashy in his appearance and stands tall above the rest. Captain Falcon is considered to be heroic and when not racing is putting away the galaxies worst to claim his rewards. Very virtuous character by many standards, and still loves to competitively race to pass the time. What is not to like? If you like racing games with very fast paced levels, investigate the original F-Zero series. Although the series has had a few remakes, the originals are by far better in the gameplay mechanics and simple usage inputs.",

Although dark Pit is not the best for character traits, he excels at basic common sense, this was proven when he deduces that it would take more than one soul to create an Underworld Monster.",
